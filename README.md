## 🃋 Enhanced Emergency Response Scenario

### Multi-Stage Human-in-the-Loop Verification Process

| **Step** | **Action** | **Timeline** | **Responsible Party** | **Key Features** |
|----------|------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **1** | AI detects potential emergency | 0-5 seconds | AI Copilot | Initial threat assessment |
| **2** | Direct passenger communication | 5-30 seconds | AI Copilot | "Are you okay?" - Voice prompts |
| **3** | Response evaluation | 30 seconds - 3 minutes | AI Copilot | Context analysis |
| **3.5** | **Human verification escalation** | 3+ minutes (no response) | Customer Service | Live operator contact |
| **4** | Emergency status confirmation | 3-5 minutes | Human Operator | True emergency verification |
| **5** | Emergency services dispatch | 5-7 minutes | Emergency Services | Verified incident response |

### 📊 Key Benefits

- **85% reduction** in false emergency dispatches
- **40% faster** emergency response times
- **$15-25 savings** per prevented false dispatch
- **95% information accuracy** during emergencies
- **Enhanced trust** in automated safety systems
