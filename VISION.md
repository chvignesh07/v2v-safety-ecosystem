Enhanced Emergency Response
🚦 Privacy Impact Statement
Privacy-First, Local-Only Safety

All vehicle-to-vehicle data is strictly limited to a 150-meter encrypted bubble—no signals ever leave the actionable safety zone.

No persistent identifiers are ever transmitted. Each session uses rotating pseudonyms and ephemeral keys.

No personal or owner data is shared. Your car’s position, turn signal, and intent are all anonymously broadcast—never linked to you or your travel history.

No central, cloud, or police surveillance. The ecosystem is purely decentralized—no entity can see a map of all vehicles.

Actionable data only: Vehicles only “see” what affects your immediate safety, no spying possible outside your driving bubble.
📚 Privacy FAQ — Industry Concerns & Solutions
Concern	Our Solution
Can I be tracked by roadside snoopers?	No. Ephemeral (rotating) IDs, session keys, and short data lifetime stop building long-term logs.
What if someone tries a “man-in-the-middle” hack?	All messages use digital signatures and session validation—spoofed packets are ignored.
Does the system reveal my home or frequent locations?	Never. No map, trip, or past data is broadcast—only what's needed in the safety bubble now.
Can my insurance, OEM, or police track me or collect logs?	Data is never transmitted to any central database—your privacy is as safe as being off the network. All logs are only on your vehicle and encrypted.
Won’t emergency scenarios still need some central reporting?	Only with your explicit consent (opt-in) are incident logs transmitted outside the vehicle, using strong encryption and anonymization.
